// Scope in JavaScript
//var x = 10; // Global scope
let a = 20; // Global scope
if(true) {
    let a = 40; // This 'a' is block-scoped
    const b = 50; // This 'b' is block-scoped
    //var c = 60; // This 'c' is function-scoped (or globally scoped if not in a function)

}


//console.log(a); // ReferenceError: a is not defined
//console.log(b); // ReferenceError: b is not defined
//console.log(c); // 60 (c is accessible here because it is function-scoped or globally scoped)

//console.log(`Global:`,a);

//Global Scope in windows and in Node.js
// In a browser, global variables become properties of the window object
// In Node.js, global variables are not properties of the global object unless declared with 'global' keyword
// console.log(window.a); // In browser, this would log 20
// console.log(global.a); // In Node.js, this would log 20 if 'a' is declared with 'global.a'
// Note: Using 'var' in the global scope will attach it to the global object in browsers, but not in Node.js
// console.log(this.a); // In Node.js, 'this' in the global scope refers to the global object, which is different from the window object in browsers
// console.log(this.b); // ReferenceError: b is not defined


/*üåê What is "Global Scope"?
Global scope refers to variables, functions, or objects that are accessible from anywhere in your code.

But how global scope behaves differs between:

üîπ Browser (Window environment)
üî∏ Node.js (Server-side)
üîπ Global Scope in the Browser (Windows)
In the browser, the global object is called **window**.

js
Copy
Edit
var name = "Eshwar";
console.log(window.name); // "Eshwar"
‚úÖ Characteristics:
Global variables declared with var become properties of window.

window represents the global execution context (like the browser window/tab).

Functions and variables declared at the top level are attached to window.

üî∏ Global Scope in Node.js
In Node.js, the global object is not window‚Äîit's called **global**.

js
Copy
Edit
var name = "Eshwar";
console.log(global.name); // undefined
‚úÖ Characteristics:
var, let, and const do not attach variables to global.

The global scope is module-scoped in Node.js (each file is its own module).

To make something truly global, you'd assign it manually:

js
Copy
Edit
global.myVar = 42;
console.log(global.myVar); // 42
*/

//Nested Scope

function one(){
    const username = "Eshwar";

    function two(){
        const website = "Eshwar.com";
        //console.log(username); // Accessing variable from outer function scope
        
    }
    //console.log(website); // ReferenceError: website is not defined
    two(); // Call the inner function to access its scope
}
one(); // Call the outer function to execute the code

if(true) {
    const username = "Eshwar";
    if(username === "Eshwar") {
        const website = " Eshwar.com";
        //console.log(username + website); // Accessing variable from outer block scope
    }
    //console.log(website); // ReferenceError: website is not defined
}
//console.log(username); // ReferenceError: username is not defined

// ++++++++++++++++ Interesting Example ++++++++++++++++

console.log(addOne(5)); // 6 // Here the function is hoisted, so it can be called before its declaration
function addOne(num){
    return num + 1
}

addTwo(5); // 7 // Here the function is not hoisted, so it cannot be called before its declaration
//console.log(addTwo(5)); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'addTwo' before initialization
const addTwo = function(num){  //Storing function in a variable // Also known as Function Expression
    return num + 2
}
